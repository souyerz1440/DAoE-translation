## CHAPTER LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Know how to use the Box-Cox method to select a variance—stabilizing transformation.

2. Understand how the generalized linear model can be used to analyze some experiments with nonnormal response distributions.

3. Understand some basic analysis methods for unbalanced factorial designs.

4. Know how to analyze an experiment with a covariate.

5. Know how to design an experiment when the values of the covariate are known in advance.

6. Know how to analyze a single-factor design with repeated measures of the response.

The subject of statistically designed experiments is an extensive one. The previous chapters have provided an introductory presentation of many of the basic concepts and methods, yet in some cases we have only been able to provide an overview. For example, there are book-length presentations of topics such as response surface methodology, mixture experiments, variance component estimation, and optimal design. In this chapter, we provide an overview of several other topics that the experimenter may potentially find useful.
